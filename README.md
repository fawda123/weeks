'weeks_bay.pdf' and 'weeks_bay.rnw' are old files of hypoxia frequency

'met_ori.RData' are metabolism estimates from observed DO time series

'met_scl.RData' are metabolism estimates from reduced (scaled) time series, 15% reduction (from Jim)

'wkbwb_met_obs.csv' is same as 'met_ori.RData'

'wkbwb_met_red.csv' is same as 'met_scl.RData'

'WKBWB_do.csv' contains observed and reduced DO time series (from Jim)

'WKBWB.RData' is  original wq time series for weeks bay, from SWMP, note that this is not the same file that Mike sent me
